Each session resulted in a completed 18” x 24” artwork. As an animal lover, this experience was profoundly fulfilling — not only did I study the anatomy and presence of the animals, but I also learned about their lifestyles and care from their breeders. Many of these animals were show animals, cherished as the pride and joy of their owners.", "Equally meaningful was the chance to share this process with others. I taught many children and adults how to paint, guiding them in plein air techniques and helping them capture the character of animals. Seeing their excitement and curiosity lit up my heart and affirmed my belief in the importance of art education as part of community life."],

I also taught attendees the art of Chinese paper cutting, sharing a technique I developed to break bad habits and create new patterns symbolically. Participants cut their designs, glued them onto paper, painted a habit they wished to release, and then gently peeled the paper, leaving behind a unique artwork that embodied transformation. To deepen the experience, I performed a traditional Chinese tea ceremony, creating space for cultural, linguistic, and historical connections with attendees."],
